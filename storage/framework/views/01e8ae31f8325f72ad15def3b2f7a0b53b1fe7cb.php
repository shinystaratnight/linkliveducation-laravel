                    <p> 
                        Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) are both security testing services that focus on identifying vulnerabilities in the network, server and network infrastructure. It is required because now more than 70% of the businesses are under cyber attack, and by 2021 cybercrime damages will cost the world $6 trillion annually. Vulnerabilities can be because of several reasons including incorrect programming practice, poor password combination and many other reasons. So it's time to find vulnerabilities in your business so you can be saved from cyber attacks.
